The Virtual Stock Exchange is a web-based stock exchange simulation engine where users can buy and sell stocks. The motivation to build a stock exchange system stems from the fact that most educational stock systems are fairly complex. Our virtual stock exchange aims to educate the user on why stock prices change, how stocks are traded and the functions of a trader. We aimed to achieve our goal by implementing features imperative to a stock exchange such as buying and selling of stocks, short selling and buy to cover.

The web application utilizes EJB 3.0. In addition to the traditional functionality of a stock exchange, such as share prices modeled to the stockâ€™s supply and demand, we implemented features such as Short Selling and Buy to Cover in order to deliver a more complete stock market (crash) experience.
